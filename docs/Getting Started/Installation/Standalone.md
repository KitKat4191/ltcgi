Before anything else, make sure your color space is set to linear:

## Installing LTCGI

Download the latest version from the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/pimaker/ltcgi/releases) over on GitHub. You only need the `ltcgi_X.Y.Z.unitypackage` file for now.

Then, simply install it into your project!
