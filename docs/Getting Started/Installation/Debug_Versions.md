# ⚠️ Debug Builds

*NOTE: These are provided as-is with no guarantees. Feel free to report any issues on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/r38vJd2DuJ), but remember that it is explicitly recommended to use the downloads from the [Releases](https://github.com/pimaker/ltcgi/releases) tab instead!*

Check the latest build from the [Actions tab](https://github.com/pimaker/ltcgi/actions/workflows/main.yml?query=is%3Asuccess) and download the corresponding *artifact* (comes as a zip you need to extract first). You must be logged in to GitHub to download the build artifacts.

For video player adapters, the same rules as with normal releases apply.
